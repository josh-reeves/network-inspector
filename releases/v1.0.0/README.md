# Releases

Releases for Windows x86/64, Windows for ARM, MacOS x64 and MacOS on Apple silicon can be found in the appropriate subdirectory. Each release is designed to be self-contained and portable. Windows releases utilize a self-contained executable with embedded debug symbols. The MacOS releases do not utilize any hard coded paths, so the application bundle can be run from anywhere, including an external drive. 

The releases have been compressed in order to save space. On Windows, the executable is stored within a zip archive. The MacOS application bundle is stored within a read-only DMG. For convenience, download links can be found below:
